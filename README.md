# WebSocketClient

## Origin

This Julia package is originally forked from https://github.com/dandeliondeathray/DandelionWebSockets.jl

## Purpose

The original DandelionWebSockets is a nice addition of a client side web socket library for Julia.

Julia is a great scientific programming tool. However, its networking functionality is very primitive.

We intend to extend DandelionWebSockets as a generic web socket client.

The typical use case is to attach one or more Julia applications to a "resource-tier" application server.
The resource-tier application server may be written in a general purpose programming language like Java.

## Usage

Please see the original README:
